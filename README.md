# What is it?

Glim HSVM model build around Slim, Propel and Twig.

# HSVM

I totally just made that up but it stands for **H**andler **S**ervice **V**iew **M**odel

## Handler

A handler is like a controller but only handles one request, every route has it's own handler.

An example handler would look like

```php
<?php

namespace Eater\Glim\Handler;

class Login extends Main
{
    function handle()
    {
        $user = this->get('user');

        $user = $user->login($this->post('username'), $this->post('password'));

        if ($user === false) {
            return "Login failed";
        } else {
            return "Welcome, {$user->name}";
        }
    }
}
```

## Service

A service is an class exposing several functions around a certain subject

for example here we have the user service

```php
<?php

namespace Eater\Glim\Service;

class User extends Main
{
    function login($username, $password)
    {
        if ($username == "4" && $password == "2") {
            $user = new \stdClass();
            $user->name = "Towel";

            return $user;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
